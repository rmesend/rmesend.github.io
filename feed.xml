      Case Study
    Esri transforms the way businesses use mapping technology to solve problems. When the software company wanted to transform its certification program to better serve its earners, it turned to digital credentials. As a global brand with certification earners around the world, Esri found digital credentials to be the best option for earners to verify their skills, share their achievements, and connect with opportunities.Implementing digital credentials has been hugely successful for Esri. The addition of digital badges has bolstered its certification program, creating branding and marketing opportunities to increase certification enrollments as well as engage with earners. This case study details how Esri created a successful badging program—from platform selection to implementation and program mapping—and how the organization measures ROI and key outcomes.Esri is a global software company that specializes in mapping and spatial analytics software. The organization’s ArcGIS software and apps combine mapping and data analytics to deliver location intelligence, and Esri offers a robust certification program to its international user community in the use and best practices of its software.There are many applications for Esri’s mapping and analytics platform. The brand’s visual mapping and storytelling tool, ArcGIS StoryMaps, enables users to present a series of maps supplemented with context from photos and copy to tell a full story about a specific geographic information system (GIS) application. It is powerful software that enables users to map geographic information to help every sector, from government entities improving roadway transportation to commercial businesses identifying the best location for a retail store. Most recently, Esri’s software is helping map the spread of the COVID-19 virus to help companies and communities map their risk areas and responses.Training and certification are critical to Esri’s engagement strategy, and it has managed an IT certification program for the organization’s employees, international distributors, global business partners, and customers for more than 10 years. In 2017, Esri launched digital credentialing on Credly’s Acclaim platform to better serve its certification candidates—and its earners are taking advantage. Almost 90% of Esri’s current credential holders are engaging with digital badging in some way—from badge acceptance and sharing to exploring labor market insights related to Esri certified skills.As a customer-focused organization managing a long-running certification program, Esri began looking at ways to better serve the needs of its certification candidates and earners. While it opted for PDF certificates as an initial way to digitally enhance its program, Esri found the static format lacking critical abilities. A PDF did not give the level of verification or integrated shareability with professional networks that could benefit earners. Esri turned to digital badges as the solution for the value they bring—digital badges are actionable, have metadata attached to them that verify skills, and are shareable.“With a static PDF, it wasn’t easy for certification candidates to show their success or showcase that achievement of being certified. The biggest draw of digital credentials was having the verification and simplicity in sharing digital badges on social platforms. It has done a lot for our customers to showcase their talents. And, it’s given Esri an opportunity to engage with our earners on social platforms like LinkedIn.”Roger Mesén-Delgado is a GIS specialist and Esri earner who uses software to improve the way his company farms. As a Smart Farming Supervisor at Fresh Del Monte-Pineapple Division, Roger has a range of responsibilities, from configuring apps for data collection to maintaining geodatabases to analyzing data collected from the field. His Esri ArcGIS digital badge helped him verify his skills during the recruiting process and gives him credibility in his role.“Earning an Esri digital badge gives me more credibility in my role, especially when discussing a topic related with GIS. Having a digital badge was also helpful during the recruiting process to verify my skills to the hiring manager.” Roger Mesén-DelgadoWhen it came to selecting a digital credentialing platform, Esri chose Credly’s Acclaim platform for its expertise in three areas: customer implementation and program success planning, marketing support, and Labor Market Insights. “One of the big selling points for Credly’s Acclaim platform versus other badging platforms is that there’s a lot of great support. Our Customer Success Manager from Credly was incredibly helpful in getting us launched and supported us after we launched. There’s also a great marketing channel team that helped us with messaging, what to put on our website, and how and when to communicate information. Having those support resources is hugely impactful to the overall success we’ve seen.” says Jessi Mielke.Access to Credly’s Labor Market Insights was also important to help earners understand the value of an Esri credential in the context of the labor market. The insights give earners access to job openings, salary ranges, related skills, and other opportunities based on the metadata embedded in their digital badge, and Esri promotes this access to prospective certificate candidates as added value.Esri offers more than 25 certifications with digital credentials across its enterprise geodata and ArcGIS software products. All certifications are exam-based, and different levels of achievement are available, from entry level to associate to professional. The program recently started offering advanced specialty exams for certification on specific skills, like GIS online administration, after candidates pass core exams. The Esri team regularly looks at data to ensure the program is effective and hitting internal goals. Every month, Esri reviews internal certification data with external digital badge data available from Credly’s Acclaim platform. Key metrics the team reviews include the number of certifications and digital badges issued, the number of users with multiple certifications, and the traffic generated by digital badge views. In a survey of Esri certification earners conducted in 2020 by Esri and Credly, 85% consider their digital badge from Esri to be valuable. Earners report experiencing a range of positive job-related benefits from their digital badge, including: earned a raisegot a promotiongot a new jobexperienced job securityexperienced other job-related benefitsbenefited financiallyEarners also report that the shareability of digital credentials is a huge benefit: 82% of Esri earners surveyed report that digital badges allow them to share their certification more easily. And, 44% say that digital badges allow others to find them more easily based on their skills.Jayanta Poddar is a geospatial IT professional who found that earning and sharing Esri digital badges led to multiple job offers. “I shared my digital badges with my professional network on LinkedIn, and also added them to my résumé. I believe I stand out for jobs requiring expertise in Esri technology, and having Esri certifications in multiple domains gave organizations confidence in my technical proficiency across the ArcGIS platform.” Poddar was offered Senior Analyst roles from a few organizations, as well as a Pre-Sales Manager role from Esri India that he accepted. Beyond validating his technical expertise, Poddar believes digital credentials continue to help his professional growth. “Digital credentials helped me gain confidence from peers and customers and boost belief in myself. They also give you an edge in moving to a new role in your organization or landing a new job opportunity.”In its IT certification program, Esri’s top priorities are finding new ways to increase certification candidates and engage with them. Digital badges help with both. First, Esri markets the value of digital credentials—additional recognition opportunities to help reach professional goals and access to labor market insights—to attract potential certification candidates. “When digital badges are shared, people are looking at them. That’s a lot of different eyes looking at your profile on LinkedIn. It could be someone sourcing for a new position or maybe an internal department looking to recruit or recognize the success of a person.” says Mielke.Ninety-one percent of Esri’s digital badge sharing happens on LinkedIn via the earner’s profile or newsfeed, and Esri leverages that sharing to engage with its earners. When earners share their digital badges, Esri will also share the post to help boost recognition and badge views for the individual earner. The program team also uses its social media channels to educate and encourage earners to accept and share their digital badges. During implementation of their program, Esri dedicated time to developing credential metadata and researching skills tags to effectively map digital badges back to certification exams. Esri’s goal: create badge templates that are focused, but not too narrow, so that credentials are representative of the exam components, have value for candidates, and sync to opportunities via Credly’s Labor Market Insights. “A huge challenge for certification programs is promoting the value of the certification. Credly’s Labor Market Insights lets us show where skills directly translate into a specific role or within an organization. It’s another data point we use to help an individual make a decision on how valuable certification will be for them.” says Mielke. The upfront work during implementation paid off. Twenty-four percent of Esri earners surveyed say that digital badges help them connect to career opportunities. And, 46% of earners say that having access to Labor Market Insights after earning a digital badge makes their Esri certification more valuable.For Esri certification earner Brent Brady, earning multiple Esri digital badges has helped him confirm his product knowledge and instill more confidence with his customers. As a GIS Consultant with Eagle Technology, a distributor for Esri’s ArcGIS platform in New Zealand, Brady uses Esri products on a daily basis to help provide advice, services, and support to a wide range of customers in both the private and public sectors. “I think the biggest benefit of earning a digital credential is confirming the associated knowledge to help me in my daily role and professional development.” says Brady. “Having digital badges allows customers I have not dealt with previously to get a quick understanding and verification of my areas of knowledge and build confidence in the level of assistance they are receiving.” After earning his digital badges, Brady shared them on LinkedIn and added them to his email signature. And, he has plans of earning additional digital badges for Esri’s Enterprise System Design. “Attaining the digital badges helps instill a level of confidence in myself and my abilities. The certification tests are not easy, and there is a great degree of satisfaction in knowing that you have the knowledge required to achieve the accreditation.” says Brady.Digital badging also gives Esri new marketing opportunities. When launching its digital badging program, Esri was able to promote something new to candidates. And, this new offering invigorated its messaging to candidates who hadn’t been certified in a while or engaged with its brand recently. One successful tactic: encouraging individuals who had earned an older Esri certification (before it had a digital credentialing program) to pursue a new certification to get a digital badge. The promotion was positively received, as individuals wanted that digital badge to more easily share and promote their skills. Digital credentials are a key component in the success of Esri’s certification program. Its earners want to be able to share their skills, get recognized for their achievements, and connect to professional opportunities, and digital credentials empower them to do all of these.

Luego se extendió al campo del <em>data mining</em> y en conjunto con otras técnicas forman la ciencia de datos. El deep learning llegó a sustituir está técnica posteriormente.</p> <p>Vladimir Vapnik es el proponente del método, trabajó en AT&amp;T Bell Labs donde hace su propuesta para hacer regresión y clasificación con máquinas de soportes, fue muy popular y actualmente ya ha sido superado. Sin embargo, aún es una buena solución para algunos casos de estudio.</p> <p>Inician con una idea que se conocía en su momento, está técnica se llama Análisis Discriminante. Esto quiere decir que se busca encontrar un hiperplano que supere a las clases con el mayor margen posible (Ver figura1).</p> <p>A nivel teórico todo MSV(Máquinas de Soporte Vectorial) es construido en la idea de que solamente existen dos categorías(por facilidad matemática), sin embargo, esta técnica funciona para n categorías.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/957/1*u7tfZE70TD_j4Otj_UcF4w.jpeg"/><figcaption>Figura1: Hiperplano de separación entre categorías.</figcaption></figure> <p>Una de las cosas que agrega este método, es que va encontrar un plano de separación con margen máximo. Se utiliza el principio de cercanía invertido. En este caso tenemos un margen que divide las categorías.</p> <p>Lo que se busca es encontrar la ecuación de un hiperplano, que divida las clases y tenga un margen máximo. Después esa ecuación se utiliza para clasificar los nuevos elementos dependiendo de dónde se ubiquen dentro del plano.</p> <h4>¿Cómo funciona?</h4> <p>Usando 2 puntos se pueden calcular y=mx + b y así con los puntos en el plano poder calcular la formula de la pendiente (m=(Y2-Y1)/(X2-X1)) y luego b para calcular la <strong>recta de separación (figura 2)</strong>. Luego se hacen traslaciones sobre las rectas de margen. Luego se puede extraer el hiperplanos no óptimos. En esos casos se busca el hiperplano con error mínimo. Esto es importante recalcar, recordemos que estamos haciendo un modelado y en la realidad pocas veces tenemos una predicción perfecta.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/454/1*LDT5S2ii2l5WBIx3S7bqnQ.png"/><figcaption>figura 2: Ecuación a resolver. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-linear-Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-case_fig2_332777280">https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-linear-Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-case_fig2_332777280</a></figcaption></figure> <p>Esta función discriminante lineal podemos tener muchas, sin embargo siempre se debe de tener el margen máximo y que se equivoque lo mínimo posible (figura 3).</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z1jbwxnuPYzV733gx0fr4g.gif"/><figcaption>Figura 3: Búsqueda del plano.</figcaption></figure> <h4>¿Qué ocurre cuando los datos no son linealmente separables?</h4> <p>Cuando los datos están con esta condición, se pueden utilizar una transformación (proyección) con una función núcleo o <em>Kernel</em> (a esto también se conoce como el truco del núcleo) para transformar los datos y así poder separarlos.</p> <p>En Python y R se tienen tres o cuatro posibles núcleos (figura 3), inclusive si fuera requerido se puede programar un kernel con el teorema de Marcer. Este da condiciones necesarias y suficientes para tener un f sea un núcleo o kernel.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/962/1*F_JAIzxttZgSuOf6mLA0zg.png"/><figcaption>Figura3 Kernel Python <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-kernels">https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-kernels</a></figcaption></figure> <h4>Vamos al código:</h4> <iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/cea264201e6df13fbc65f34db0d46481/href">https://medium.com/media/cea264201e6df13fbc65f34db0d46481/href</a></iframe> <p>Se puede revisar el proyecto con los datos para el ejemplo aquí:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/rmesend/SVM/blob/main/SVM%20PIPELINES.ipynb">SVM/SVM PIPELINES.ipynb at main · rmesend/SVM</a></p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6fd908563a4" width="1" height="1" alt=""/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">SAR — Una Introducción</title><link href="https://rmesend.github.io/blog/2021/saruna-introduccin/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SAR — Una Introducción"/><published>2021-05-02T23:46:22+00:00</published><updated>2021-05-02T23:46:22+00:00</updated><id>https://rmesend.github.io/blog/2021/saruna-introduccin</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://rmesend.github.io/blog/2021/saruna-introduccin/"><![CDATA[<h3>SAR — Una Introducción</h3> <h4>De los sensores remotos al Radar de Apertura Sintética(SAR)</h4> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2aLFoQTwHO8INC7vsjIbYg.jpeg"/><figcaption>PN Chirripó, Costa Rica</figcaption></figure> <h4>Generalidades:</h4> <p>Este artículo pretende dar una base conceptual para iniciar el proceso de aprendizaje en el caminos de SAR, es el primero de varios dentro de los que se espera tener una práctica que permita complementar la información acá brindada. Además, servir de repositorio de varios documentos que permiten indagar a profundidad sobre el tema.</p> <h4>Espectro Electromagnético</h4> <p>Es un concepto que permite definir energía radiante con respecto a su longitud de onda o frecuencia. Los valores de longitud de onda son continuos pero se clasifican por medio de secciones donde se comportan de manera similar: Espectro Visible, Infrarojo y micro-ondas (ver <em>figura 1</em>).</p> <figure><img alt="Espectro electromagnético en todas sus bandas" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*OcNBmUaUlMyQOPafI7T0mA.jpeg"/><figcaption>Figura 1: Espectro tomado de Chuvieco, 2008.</figcaption></figure> <p>El <strong>espectro Visible</strong> (0,4–0,8 µm): Básicamente es denominado así por ser el único visible para nosostros como seres humanos. Dentro de esta sección hay 3 subcategorías: A(0,4µm–0,5µm) V(0,5µm–0,6µm) y R(0,6µm-0,7µm). Estos tres serían los valores primarios que nuestros ojos observan (ver <em>figura 1</em>).</p> <p><strong>Infrarrojo Cercano</strong> (0,7µm-1,3µm): esta banda permite identificar entre masas vegetales y concentraciones de humedad.</p> <p><strong>Infrarrojo Medio</strong> (1,3µm-8µm): Se utiliza para identificar focos de energía elevados, como por ejemplo incendios forestales y volcanes en erupción.</p> <p><strong>Infrarrojo Lejano</strong> (8µm-14µm): sirve para detectar la mayor parte de las cubiertas terrestres.</p> <p><strong>Borde Rojo</strong>(712µm–722µm): es una banda que en los últimos años se ha estudiado como indicador de la clorofila en las plantas. Esta banda permite identificar de forma temprana enfermedades en plantas.</p> <p><strong>Micro-Ondas</strong> (mayor a 1 mm): son ondas de gran tamaño, esto permite que penetren en zonas con nubosidad. Estas son las longitudes de onda que se revisan a detalle.</p> <p>Un punto muy importante es la relación de longitud de onda vrs la frecuencia, a mayor longitud de onda menor frecuencia y a mayor frecuencia mayor energía.</p> <p><strong>Radar Pasivo</strong>: Emisión de energía en microondas emitidas por la superficie terrestre o por objetos. Es decir un objeto se calienta y emite en ciertas longitudes de onda y esto hace que se detecten, longitudes de onda altas.</p> <p><strong>Radar Activos</strong>: un sensor emite su propia radiación y esta choca contra el receptor(mide la señal, esta señal de regreso se llama retrodispeción). El radar activo tiene una gran capacidad de medir características físicas del terreno. Los radares de hoy en día poseen una gran resolución.</p> <figure><img alt="Tipos de radar: activos y pasivos" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xecz6LcUYIyVlL4m_0zehA.png"/><figcaption>Figura 2: Tipo de sensores, tomado de (Solano, 2009). Aunque los radares en esta imágen solo aparecen en la sección de activos, los mismo puede pertenecer a las 2 categorías.</figcaption></figure> <h4>SAR, ¿por qué? y algunos principios básicos</h4> <p><strong>Atenuación:</strong> es la perdida energética que tiene una onda al viajar sobre un medio, sea la atmósfera u otro medio. Este factor hace que el uso de SAR tenga una gran ventaja ya que no es absorbido por la nubosidad o por algún factor atmosférico.</p> <p>La <strong>dispersión y coeficiente retro-disperción</strong>: Cuando se hace teledetección con radar tenemos que tomar en cuenta que es diferente a la óptica. Esta última al tener longitudes de onda cortos es prácticamente reflejada. Sin embargo, las longitudes de onda del radar son tan grandes que pueden penetrar la superficie (Ver Figura 3). De forma que la dispersión sería el resultado de la combinación con la superficie afectada, su interior o composición y forma geométrica.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/788/1*m61UXRMcQ_Nuyb0Alx3wsg.png"/><figcaption>Figura 3: Dispersión de diferentes superficies (Modificado del Instituto Geográfico de España, 2018 pag. 9) .</figcaption></figure> <p>Un principio importante con esto es que a mayor sea la rugosidad de la superficie mayor será la retro-dispersión y con ello mayor brillo tendrá en la imagen generada. De igual manera las superficies lisas reflejan poca energía de vuelta, esto las hace verse en tonos grises oscuros. En el caso de la vegetación como se observa en la figura 3 tiene una rugosidad moderada por lo que se denota en colores grises claros (Instituto Geográfico España, 2018 pag. 10).</p> <p>La <strong>constante dieléctric</strong>a es un valor que tienen los objetos o superficies a la hora de reflectar la energía. Por ejemplo: el agua y los objetos metálicos tienen un valor alto (80) mientras que un suelo seco tienen esta variable baja (3–8). Esto nos sirve para entender la humedad en el suelo y la diferencia en zonas boscosas contra deforestadas.(Instituto Geográfico España, 2018 pag. 10)</p> <h4>Geometría básica de SAR</h4> <p>SLAR desarrollados en los 50, transportada en una aeronave de forma lateral, estos permitían reconocer objetos debajo de la cobertura. Estos transmiten haces estrechos con forma abanico desde el avión. Tenemos 3 ángulos importantes: incidencia, observación y depresión.</p> <p>El <strong>Ángulo de Incidencia</strong> es el que entra en la dirección de iluminación del radar y la vertical sobe la superficie del terreno (Ver Figura 4). Este ángulo toma en cuenta la inclinación local de la superficie. Influye en la intensidad de la imagen en cada pixel.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AQzu6lK-RtoFua8mY_yjew.png"/><figcaption>Figura 4: Ángulo de incidencia y formas de reflejar con respecto a los diferentes tipos de superficie. Modificado de (Instituto Geográfico España, 2018 pag. 11).</figcaption></figure> <p>Otros factores importantes de este ángulo están relacionados con los efectos sobre la dispersión en la superficie que tienen, estos son que tendrá una 1. dispersión fuerte con un <strong>ángulo de incidencia bajo</strong>, 2. <strong>cuanto más áspera la superficie más lenta será la reducción</strong> y finalmente, 3. se <strong>reduce con el incremento en el ángulo de incidencia </strong>(Instituto Geográfico España, 2018 pag. 11).</p> <p>Cuando hablamos de imágenes de radar tenemos que tener en cuenta que existen 2 tipo de resolución. En rango, es el pixel generado a raíz del Swath o área iluminada y la resolución en azimut, esta es la que hace referencia a la resolución asociada con la dirección de vuelo y el área que este impacta con cada envío de energía (Woodhouse, 2006).</p> <p>Gracias al efecto Doppler permitió hacer un cambio en la tecnología para la recolección de las imágenes de radar. Y es a partir de este punto que se inician la tecnología de Radar de Apertura Sintética que nos permite recolectar información como si fuera una antena de mayor tamaño.</p> <p>Las microondas tienen diferentes bandas estas son porciones de longitud de onda que son detectadas por los sensores, estos sensores son específicos para cada una de las aplicaciones que se quiere. Recordemos que las diferentes bandas tienen diferentes aplicaciones, algunos ejemplos de bandas son:K, Ka, Ku, X, C, S, L y P.</p> <p>Para el caso de la <strong>X</strong> (3,8cm –2,4cm), es una banda que se usa para el monitoreo de urbanización, masas de hielo y nieve (ver figura 5). La <strong>C</strong>(7,5cm–3.8cm) es una banda muy generalista que funciona para el monitoreo de cambios en vegetación y movimiento en navegación sobre el mar. <strong>L</strong>(30cm-15cm)es una banda de alta penetración utilizada principalmente para la biomasa sobre algunas zonas boscosas. Permite ver el cambio cuando por ejemplo se da la tala(NASA ARSET, 2017).</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/776/1*fVaUXJ2ZbYTVZ-UnQ81Ujw.png"/><figcaption>Figura 5: Bandas de Radar. Tomado de (NASA ARSET, 2017)</figcaption></figure> <p>Polarización: La polarización es la forma en la que se envía y recibe las ondas, estas ondas pueden mezclarse para combinar estas 2 opciones(Woodhouse, 2006).</p> <h4>Errores de captura con SAR:</h4> <p>Con esta gran tecnología tenemos tres errores principales que se relacionan. Estos son el desplazamiento de estructuras, la inversión por relieve, la sombra y el moteado.</p> <p>El <strong>desplazamiento de estructuras</strong> (<em>foresthortening</em>) se da cuando una pendiente está orientada al sensor y aparece acortada en la imagen. Este efecto disminuye con el aumento en el ángulo de incidencia. El otro es el de <strong>inversión por relieve</strong> (<em>layover</em>), se da cuando tenemos un cambio abrupto en el terreno haciendo que el punto más alto llegue primero que el enviado en un punto más bajo. Este se corrige con aumento en el ángulo de incidencia. Finalmente, tenemos la <strong>sombra</strong> (<em>shadows</em>); esta está relacionada con la parte que no se puede observar en una órbita y que deja sin visualizar un punto de los datos recolectados (NASA ARSET, 2017).</p> <p>El <strong>moteado</strong> (<em>Speckle</em>) es un ruido granular inherente que degrada la resolución de la imagen SAR. Este inconveniente se reduce con un procesado de multi-look que promedia las zonas con esto y suma de imágenes que si obtuvieron valores entre sí, también hay otros postprocesos como el filtrado espacial donde se extrapola la información de los pixeles adyacentes para rellenar los datos que no se encontraron (NASA ARSET, 2017).</p> <p>Sin duda, los SAR tienen ya actualmente una gran variedad de aplicaciones. Estas puede ir de la identificación de zonas inundadas a la pérdida de cobertura boscosa. La gran versatilidad en los radares y su utilización aún en climas extremos los hacen de gran ayuda para recolección de datos en todo momento.</p> <p>Notas sobre el tema: En principio este documento espera ser una guía básica para iniciar a comprender los sensores y la tecnología SAR. Pretende ser un repositorio donde se pueda consultar información y revisar términos para entender este maravilloso mundo. Espero continuar con la serie de pequeños blogs para llevar esto a la práctica en las siguientes entregas.</p> <h3>Trabajos citados</h3> <p>Chuvieco, E.

O solución. Todo depende desde dónde lo miremos, o desde dónde nos mire. Qué tema más olvidado, en plena pandemia en plena crisis económica. ¿El amor mueve montañas? O las montañas se nos mueven cuando estamos enamorados. ¿Estamos enamorados? O simplemente nos enamoran.En la antigua Grecia decía Empédocles que todo estaba constituido de cuatro elementos, estos eran: agua, aire, tierra y fuego. El amor los une y la discordia los separa, es así como tenemos el primer punto del amor, que el amor une. Algo nos deja claro esto primero, es que el tenemos una unión inicial esa relación que siempre está dada por esa metafísica del amor. Esa parte que nunca nos cierra, ni con datos estadísticos o biológicos. Hay algo siempre que se queda esperando, ahí escondido, que no se le muestra a la ciencia. O que no queremos que se muestre. Y no lo hará.El amor nos ha dado tanto de qué hablar, tanto de que escribir. Miles o millones de baladas dedicadas miles de obras hechas. Según Schopenhauer en el fondo es un engaño para que el instinto de especie se coloque sobre nosotros y evitemos la individualidad para reproducirnos. ¿Cabe en el siglo XXI una explicación así? No lo se, pero en definitiva al ritmo que vamos habrá que ver qué ocurrirá cuando la reproducción no sea vinculada con el amor.Existe una vieja balada medieval danesa, en donde se cuenta la historia de un amor imposible que además se vuelve trágico. Una joven Hellelil quien es la hija de un noble, se enamora de uno de sus doce guardias quien es un príncipe de Inglaterra de nombre Hildebrand. La historia termina con nuestro novio muriendo y llevándose consigo al padre y a seis de los siete hermanos. Él no tenía la clase suficiente según su padre para ser un pretendiente de su hija.La política y la economía viven relacionadas con el amor, ellas desde el inicio han marcado en todas sociedades y dictado muchas de las relaciones que se crean. Ahora hagamos retrospectiva, ¿hoy vivimos fuera de esto? ¿Hay algún padre al cual enfrentarnos a duelo? Bueno, más allá de un familiar en contra, existen mecanismos que dictan la idoneidad para el novio o la novia. El negocio dentro de una sociedad capitalista es lo central, ¿no? Es así como muchos eligen a sus cónyuges; hacen negocio y al final mueren felices, pensando que estuvieron en el amor, cuando en realidad se la pasaron haciendo negocio. Siempre, el amor de buenas a primeras es por definición an-económico.Cuanto menos nos convenga nos impulsa más el deseo de lo inconveniente. Así es el amor, algo nos lleva. Uno cuando ama lucha con la lógica. Somos víctimas de la pasión (padecer, según su origen latín), por ellos somos pasivos y nos envuelve en ese manto el amor. Nos dejamos llevar por Eros quien nos dispara y nosotros simplemente nos enamoramos.Hoy cupido está institucionalizado, él se viste de aplicación de teléfono que nos da opciones a la redonda. Muchas veces nos brinda oportunidades en redes sociales. Estas que muestran lo mejor de nosotros. Como productos de mercadotecnia nos mostramos en un estante bonito y estandarizado para todos, que brinda más o menos me gusta. Según Zizek tenemos grandes inconvenientes con esto, y es esa chispa final que enciende el amor. Nosotros adoramos la imperfección sobre lo liso y pulido. Esa diferencia que cambia la perfección, que la anula. Esto no se muestra en las redes sociales. Y esto también conlleva a una gran decepción cuando conocemos la realidad de ese otro. Esos problemas que no se tenían cartografiados en el inicio y que comienzan a salir. Son tiempos muy interesantes para ver los grandes cambios en todos los paradigmas del amor. ¿O cambian los paradigmas?, o ¿cambian los medios para enamorarnos?Este artículo representa el criterio de quien lo firma.
